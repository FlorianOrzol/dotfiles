# General

This is my configuration for the Herbstluftwm desktop manager.

I work with multiple monitors.
In addition to my "work monitor," I have two additional "monitors" that usually serve as sources of information related to my work topic, which is why I chose this approach.

In this setup, I not only want to switch between individual tags but also navigate through complete virtual desktop environments using shortcuts, similar to conventional desktop managers.

To achieve this, the virtual-desktops file is used.
